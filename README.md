Todo / ideas
- ~~Login with Facebook so you don't need a manual API key~~
- Bubble popup with info on friend
- Make friend list at bottom zoom in on click
- Pie menu for friends living in same town
- Get latest location from friends from checkins
- Show mutual friend connections
- ~~FIX: seem to be missing some friends compared to http://geographics.cz/socialMap/ ~~
- Heatmap layer of friend density
- ~~Google Analytics to stalk users~~
- Loading progress indicator
- Bring user pic to front on hover, in case of overlap
- Some map controls
- ~~Full screen map~~
- ~~Fix race condition "FB.getLoginStatus() called before calling FB.init()."~~ Think I got it with custom event
- Limit map moving and zooming to not out of screen
- Show read friend count instead of waiting with timeout
- Group friends list by continent/country/city. Lat/lng based?
